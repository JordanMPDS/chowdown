ingredients:
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1/2 cup hot tap water
- 1/3 cup bread flour
- prepared paste
- 3 tsp instant yeast (2 packets)
- 2/3 cup milk warmed to 100째 Fahrenheit
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3 Tbsp Kerrygold salted butter melted
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 2/3 cup bread flour
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream to pour over risen rolls before baking
- 1 cup light brown sugar packed
- 2 Tbsp cinnamon
- 8 Tbsp Kerrygold salted butter softened
- 1 <sup>1/2</sup> cup powdered sugar
- 2 Tbsp melted butter
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 1/4 cup milk or half & half
- Orange zest and juice to taste

directions:
- Make your paste by adding 1/3 cup milk, 1/2 cup hot tap water and 1/3 cup bread flour. Turn heat to medium and whisk until a thick paste forms and the lumps are all worked out. Set aside.
- In another pot warm 2/3 cup milk over low medium heat until it reaches 100-110째 Fahrenheit. Use a thermometer to check.
- Add warm milk and instant yeast to a large mixing bowl or to a stand mixer bowl.
- To the yeast and milk add the sugar, melted salted butter, egg, salt and prepared paste. Mix on low until everything is combined.
- Add 3 2/3 cup bread flour one cup at a time to the mixture. Allow it to come together then switch out the paddle for the dough hook. Knead for 15 minutes on medium speed.
- Place dough ball in a lightly greased bowl and cover for an hour in a warm dry place. I either preheat my oven to 200째 and turn it off once I put the bowl in the oven or I place in the microwave (off of course) covered in saran wrap.
- Roll dough out on a floured surface to 24x15"
- Spread 8 Tbsp or a stick of softened kerrygold salted butter evenly over top of the dough. It needs to be extra soft but not melted.
- Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl then sprinkle on top of the butter and dough evenly.
- Tightly roll up the dough and cut into 10-12 rolls.
- Place on a parchment lined sheet pan with space between each roll.
- Warm heavy whipping cream and pour over the rolls.
- Bake at 375째 for 18-20 minutes.
- While the rolls bake, mix the icing with the whisk attachment or a hand mixer. Add cream cheese, salted butter and beat until fluffy. Add powdered sugar one cup at a time. Scrape the bowl as needed. Add the vanilla and mix until fully combined.
- Allow rolls to rest 5-10 minutes before slathering in icing.
